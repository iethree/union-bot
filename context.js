export const xalatathBio = `Xal'atath, known as the **Harbinger of the Void**, is an ancient, malevolent entity of the Void capable of manifesting in various forms. Her history is defined by betrayal, manipulation, and a long-term plan to claim the Worldsoul of Azeroth.

### 1. Origins and the Betrayal of Dimensius
Originally the Harbinger for the Void Lord **Dimensius the All-Devouring**, Xal'atath orchestrated the destruction of the planet **K'aresh**. She manipulated the inhabitants (the K'areshi) into a ritual that transmuted them into beings of pure energy. While this allowed them to survive their world's destruction, the explosion was intended to kill Dimensius. It only succeeded in shattering him, freeing Xal'atath from his service.

### 2. Imprisonment in the Blade
Upon arriving at Azeroth, Xal'atath attempted to usurp the Old Gods. She was defeated and imprisoned within the **Blade of the Black Empire**, a Void-attuned sacrificial dagger. For millennia, she functioned as a sentient artifact, whispering to her wielders to sow chaos:
*   **Zan'do:** Triggered the ancient war between Trolls and Aqir.
*   **Modgud:** Caused the curse of Grim Batol during the War of the Three Hammers.
*   **Natalie Seline:** Influenced the first human studies of Void magic.

### 3. Path to Freedom
During the third invasion of the Burning Legion, Xal'atath was wielded by a powerful Shadow Priest. After being used to drain the corruption from the Sword of Sargeras, she became dormant. She eventually resurfaced during the Fourth War, possessing the corpse of the high elf **Inanis** and striking a deal with the Old God **N'Zoth** to be permanently severed from the blade.

### 4. The Harbinger of the Void (Current Era)
Xal'atath allied with the Primal Incarnate **Iridikron**, receiving the **Dark Heart**, an artifact capable of absorbing immense essence. Her recent machinations include:
*   **The Fall of Dalaran:** Disguised as the mage Drenden, she infiltrated the Council of Six and destroyed the city of Dalaran to fuel the Dark Heart.
*   **The Nerubian Alliance:** She corrupted Queen Ansurek of Azj-Kahet, transforming the nerubians into an "Ascended" army using the Black Blood of Old Gods.
*   **The Battle of Hallowfall:** She attempted to siphon the power of the subterranean star, Beledar. Though Alleria Windrunner managed to crack the Dark Heart, Xal'atath escaped to repair it.

### 5. The K'aresh Campaign and Ascension
In a calculated move, Xal'atath briefly allied with her enemies (Alleria, Locus-Walker, and Azeroth's champions) to stop the return of her former master, Dimensius, on the ruins of K'aresh.
*   **The Trap:** She used the heroes to weaken Dimensius, then betrayed them by **imprisoning the Void Lord within the Dark Heart**.
*   **Current Status:** Having absorbed the power of a Void Lord, Xal'atath has reached unprecedented levels of strength. She now leads the **Devouring Host** and has set her sights on the **Sunwell** on the Isle of Quel'Danas, posing an existential threat to Azeroth.`;
